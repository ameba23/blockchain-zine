our submission to more automation and control, or the path to a more free and decentralised world?

## what is the blockchain?  

Firstly lets make a distinction between the blockchain,
which is broadly speaking a part of the technology behind
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the cryptocurrencies
themselves, because the blockchain can be used for many other
things as well as currency.  

Put simply it is a method of
authenticating an individual entity over an untrusted
network.  

It is undoubtably an important technological breakthrough, and has potentially very
many applications.  Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency using this technology, and at the time
of writing the most widely used by far, although many others now exist which use modified
versions of the bitcoin software, and it is quite possible that another will in the future prove to be more popular.  Because of this when I talk about Bitcoin I am talking about Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, it is the idea I want to talk about, not the technical details or particular groups involved.  

There are several good texts and books about cryptocurrencies and the story of bitcoin, which place it in the context of the history of monetary systems.  Putting it into this context makes it not seem like such a wacky idea, or rather its not so wacky compared to the financial system we currently use. Fiat currency can be limitlessly created by governments, devaluing the money we have, meaning that when we having our savings in fiat currency we put our trust in the government.  Bitcoin however has a fixed, finite supply.  


The blockchain, as an authentication technique, solves a
longstanding problem in computer science, thought by many to
be unsolvable.  

Because of the initial media hype around Bitcoin, it was difficult to know whether to take the project seriously..
It is not until one gets an understanding of how genuinely
decentralised they could be, to have a secure method of
authenticating payments between psudoanonymous individuals
on an insecure network with no trusted third party, that it becomes clear that there is really something innovative here.  Not
just a new media buzzword but a tool that we now have which was
previously unavailble.  Just as the popularisation of
encryption software such as PGP/GPG openend a new
possibility for people far away from each other to
communicate in secret, the blockchain lets us do things we
couldnt do before.

Dominic Frisby uses the Rai stone currency used on the island of Yap as a way to explain the idea of bitcoin.  On the island, beautiful Rai stones are exchanged for things.  Some of them however, are too big to be moved, and stand at various places around the village.  These big stones are not exchanged very often, but when they are everybody knows who the stone now belongs to even though it has not moved.  This could be compared to the public ledger of that is the bitcoin blockchain.  Who-owns-what is stored on many different computers and is continously viewable, making the system very difficult to undermine.  

Using the Bitcoin blockchain to authenticate things other than currency transactions, is often known as bitcoin 2.0, and can be used for registering the ownership of other assets suchs as land, property, cars, intellectual property, or more complex applications such as automatically enforced 'smart contracts', for example renting or borrowing , a work contract, marriage, etc. 

In principle, these blockchain applications such as smart contracts can be used to cut the 'middle man' out of internet-based interactions, changing the topology from a client-server model to direct interactions between peers.  

Ben Schreckinger claims there is a blockchain-based equity market emerging which will pull the rug from under the feet of stock exchanges and various other financial institutions, and that this will be considerably more significant and disruptive than the adoption of bitcoin as a currency.  It seems that many financial, governmental and other kinds of institutes stand to loose their power and significance because of blockchain applications, and Schreckinger thinks regulating authorities may be cautious to intervene for fear of being less 'progressive' than other governments.  

An alternative blockchain system called Ethereum, which is intendend for use by the 'Internet of Things', machine-to-machine interactions, as well as other applications. 


Environmentalists have raised concerns about bitcoin mining.  The financial incentive means that many people run powerful computers solely for the perpose of bitcoin mining.  Electricity wasted.  computer heater?

It could be that 'smart contracts' while very secure
from a technical point of view, could be exploited by
loop-holes in their design.  Melanie Swan uses the example
of a grandparent using a smart contract to give an
inheritance gift to a grandchild either on the 18th birtday
of the child or on the day of the death of the grandparent.
the death could be varified by checking some kind of
reputable online
newspaper orbituary or a registry of death, which perhaps
only doctors are able to modify.  it is easy to see how one
might try to think of ways of tricking the system, and so
extra levels of security are required to, for example,
verify the identity of a doctor.  

Another example is the idea of a 'smart' car which is bought on credit which will not start if repayments are not kept up.  We can imagine other oppressive mechanisms being put in place as more control of different aspects of our lives are computerised.

Sounds like being policed by robots. 

More automation and more security culture does not seem to be a step in the
direction of a more free and autonomous society.  

### Advantages of micropayments

One of the major advantages of bitcoin over traditional payment systems is the possibility to transact tiny amounts which are only significant cumulatively.  Transaction fees associated with credit cards make small payments not worthwile.  This has many applications with the 'internet of things' machine to machine transactions, such as a car which is in a hurry automatically compensating other cars to take less direct routes. 



## Projects 

### OpenBazaar

The OpenBazaar project aims to create an online market (like ebay) which has no centralised server, it consists only of a network of individuals running the OpenBazaar software to buy and sell items from each other.  The rules and regulation of how it works are determined only by the software itself, which is of course open source, making it considerably more democratic than systems like ebay.  Although slightly more tricky to use than ebay, as the software must first be installed, the obvious immediate advantage over ebay is that there are no fees.  This makes it possible that it will gain popularity very quickly, and its decentralised nature makes it very difficult to regulate in any way.  

The openbazaar developers appear to be genuinely motivated
by creating something for free for everybody to use.  but
when they talk about 'making trade free' on the promotional
video, i cant help but associate it with free market global
capitalism, a system which inherently benefits a minority.

### Liftsharing

Blockchain-based peer-to peer liftshare software has been proposed.  This is something much needed.  There seems to be a trend in european
liftshare websites that they start out by allowing the driver and passenger to directly
communicate for free, and payment to be made directly by putting cash in the hand of the driver
usually at the end of the journey (covoiturage.fr, mitfahrgelegenheit.de).  They become very popular and then introduce a fee and some regulation
system which makes it supposedly more 'trustworthy' but also very inconvenient, requiring
verified registration, credit card payment, etc.  Then nearly all
the users move to another website which is less regulated and at some point the same thing could happen.  

This looks like a job for the blockchain.  The only reason we use these websites is
because everyone else does - the more popular a site is, the likely you are to find what you
need.  Whats we need is for the users themselves to talk to each other.  

An american
software project called 'lazooz' proposes a decentralised liftshare system which aims to work in a more ad-hoc way
than current systems.  Currently most liftshares are organised a day or two in advance or at
least a couple of hours before.  With lazooz it is possible for potential passengers to be
notified when a car driving in the direction they want is physically nearby.  This gives the possibility for a
much more spontanous liftshare system,  where you can simply go when you are ready and not have
to wait for a fixed appointment.  One of the annoying things about taking liftshares as opposed
to having your own vehicle is not being able to be
flexible about when you are going somewhere.  

However, this system, although it might represent a
technological breakthrough, is basically a complicated way of organising hitchhiking.  Does this
represent a loss of trust, a loss of community, that we would only let a stranger in our car if
the computer tells us to?  Or is it an effective way to share costs and potentially create a
decentralised public transport system?

--hitchhiking?  i haven't seen a hitchhiker for years.   

We could extent the liftshare idea to an 'almost punk-post' system.  Punk post is a genuinely
anarchic postal system where you give someone a letter or package who is travelling in the direction of the
recipiant and they pass it along.  It requires a lot of trust.  In a blockchain-based system
however, 'micro-payments' could be given to add incentive, and items could be tracked.  You only
need to move the thing a part of the journey, which maybe you are making anyway, and put it
in a safe place or pass it to someone else, a step in the direction of where it needs to go.  The
blockchain makes you accountable for things while they are in your hands, and some kind of
conflict resolution system could be devised for when things go wrong.   So we could have a decentralised delivery system.

This could be extended to some logistics/distribution system.  You could drive around in a
vehicle (maybe your own, maybe hired, or maybe it comes as part of the collabourative
distribution system) and pick up a load if it is deemed to be cost-effective to transport it.
There could be some regulation and accountability system built in to the software.  the software
is your boss.  Don't like the rules?  Fork it and start a new system.  But the new system will
have to gain acceptance by others in order to be useful.  and maybe also infrastructure, such as
vehicles, storage space or staff-facilities, belongs to the current distribution system itself,
meaning the a new system will take a long time, or have to be really a lot better, in order to
become widely accepted and thus useful.  Alternatively you could propose a change to the system
you are using.  How this works depend on the kind of open-source lisence the software has.  Since
a change would effect a lot of people there would likely be some kind of regulation system.
Although it is genuinely decentralised, this seems slowly less anarchic that our original idea.   

open source software - guaranteed to be good for its users.  Don't like it?  Fork it.  What about
software which favours individual users to the detriment of others?  In many torrent clients it
is possible to change a setting to become greedy, downloading from others but not allowing
uploads.  If everyone did this the system simply would not work.  But of course somehow it does
work.

===if i dont know you i dont trust you===

does not being able to trust people you have never met represent a loss of genuine trust between humans which was once the very basis of our communities?  trust is usually built on social activity, spending time together, communicating, building emotional attachments that mean we care about each other. 

is it the case that we need this because our 'communities' have got too big for trust or 'community spirit' to be possible?  Is there not something beautiful about trusting random people?

'trustless' example
trust?  I don't trust anyone but the computer
--wake up, go to work
--can i borrow a cup of sugar?




Compared to a moneyless utopia built on genuine community,
the blockchain does not seem so great, and maybe if you have
already found your way to such a community you should stop
reading this.  but for those of us who begrudingly use
systems which rely on a centralised trusted party, the
blockchain could be just what we need.  the idea is that we
can create cooperative alternatives to banks, insurance
companies, ebay, paypal, and potenitally a whole lot more.
We can collabourate with individuals without needing to know
or trust them.  for example to  borrow something from someone
you have never met while remaining accountable, with a
mechanism for resolving disputes which doesnt not rely on
anything centralised. 

----sort this bit out.  you cannot borrow without some asset, oder
this sounds good.  imagine being able to borrow money or
resources,
without paying for someone to cover themselves in case you dont
pay it back.  Collabourating with a group big enough to
safely pool a considerable amount of money between in each,
without the limit of needing to be so
small that they can all know each other well enough to give
such trust.  money would not sit in storage but dynamically
and effortlessly 
flow around to where it is currently needed.  

----
but would this actually abstract the whole perpose of money?
an abstraction of the same sort which gave rise to the financial
crisis - imaginary money being pushed around?  bitcoin was
developed as a response to this ridiculous situation.  
---
however bitcoin, it seems to me, is something 
inherently more solid than fiat currency, where banks can limitlessly create more money,
thereby devaluing our existing money.  

i would like to think that this abstraction of money brought
about by such a wide scale collabouration between
individuals, would form part of a path towards removing the
significance and importance of money in the minds of its
users.  which could be the key to transforming this
competitive and individualist society.  

but how could the problems of food distribution, access to
land, etc. be solved?
--
many aspects of today's 'work' rely on paying someone just to be
accountable, and secure.  this could be automated in a
cooperative way, where corruption is visible to all.  thus
pulling the rug from under the feet of office workers.

swarm is a crowdfunding platform which uses blockchain technology to sell equity, to individuals wanting to help a project.  Co-founder and CEO Joel Dietz speaks in an interview about wanting to disrupt the financial system and to empower people.  He has also appeared on an anarchist webcast program 'anarchast' and said that his influences come from studying early chinese philosophy.  The crowdfunding model differs from other projects like kickstarter, such as kickstarter, in that investors have a financial incentive, like shareholders.  Selling these equity 'tokens' seems to be a legal grey area.  Swarm promotes an alternative model for business 'distributed collabourative organisations', and amoung the projects using the model is an e-health platform, pointnurse where patients can pay to contact a nurse over the internet.  

--possibility that the US or other superpower might secretly have the computing resources to break the blockchain.  or if they dont already they might think about getting such a computer.
